This document is a modified version of Google's Javascript style guide. The
structure and language of the document is very similar to Google's but
modifications have been made where deemed suitable by the author(s). Google, in
no way, endorses or supports RPS or OceansMap.

# 1. Introduction

This document serves as the coding standards for source code in the JavaScript
programming language. 

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic
issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as
well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that
we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable
(whether by human or tool).
