# 1. Introduction

This document serves as the coding standards for source code in the JavaScript
programming language. 

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic
issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as
well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that
we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable
(whether by human or tool).

## 1.1 Terminology Notes

In this document, unless otherwise clarified:

1. The term comment always refers to implementation comments. We do not use the
   phrase documentation comments, instead using the common term "JSDoc" for
   both human-readable text and machine-readable annotations within `/** â€¦ */`.

2. This Style Guide uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
   terminology when using the phrases must, must not, should, should not, and
   may. The terms prefer and avoid correspond to should and should not,
   respectively. Imperative and declarative statements are prescriptive and
   correspond to must.

Other "terminology notes" will appear occasionally throughout the document.

## 1.2 Guide notes

Example code in this document is **non-normative**. That is, while the examples
follow OceansMap conventions, they may not illustrate the only stylish way to
represent the code. Optional formatting choices made in examples must not be
enforced as rules.
